# DrugBuddy

This is an application for helping people take medication correctly. It will include several features:

## Drug interaction lookup
Users can enter a drug and browse a complete list of possible drug-drug interactions from the NIH database. Alternatively, users can enter a list of drug and see if they interact with each other. Users can opt to download the entire list of interactions for offline use, or just for a select few drugs.

## Medication reminder
Users can enter when they took a medication and when they need to take it again, or how long they need to wait to take it again. If the users adds two drugs that interact, they will be notified.

## Medication history
The app will remember when and how much of a drug the user entered.
